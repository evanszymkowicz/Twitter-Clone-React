(Captain's Log?)

Server-side code base is completeled. Front-end interface built with React is not. Initial commit delayed by package bundler (GitHub support not enabled?)

## October 9, 2018:

Significant trouble uploading packaged app (built with Create React App) to existing GitHub repo. Future projects will have local GitHub instianted prior to creating app.
